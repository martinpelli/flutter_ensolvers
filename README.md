# flutter_ensolvers
A simple web application that allows you to create to-do items and folders to group them.

This is an app for the ensolvers team, 

Technologies:
-**frontend**: flutter
-**backend**: mongoose, Node.Js

-----What I have done:

-Phase 1
User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to create, edit and delete to-do items
- As a user, I want to mark/unmark to-do items as completed

-Phase 2
User stories
- As a user, I want to be able to create and remove new folders. NOTE: removing new folders
will remove all the tasks belonging to it
- As a user, I want to be able to navigate to the item list inside a folder and manipulate the
items using the same UI implemented in Phase 1

Problems:
**Time**: Today I spent like 8 hs to only trying to fix an error on Node Js that didn't let me use two models, so the database is inconsistent, redundant. Instead of saving the tasks in folders, I would have been like to only save the tasks id, but at least is working.
I didn't have enough time to upload the app and the DB. So itÂ´s only working if you clone the repo and make the proper installs.
