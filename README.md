# flutter_ensolvers
A simple web application that allows you to create to-do items and folders to group them.

This is an app for the ensolvers team, 

Technologies:
-**frontend**: flutter
-**backend**: mongoose, MongoDB, Node.Js

-----What I have done:

-Phase 1
User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to create, edit and delete to-do items
- As a user, I want to mark/unmark to-do items as completed

-Phase 2
User stories
- As a user, I want to be able to create and remove new folders. NOTE: removing new folders
will remove all the tasks belonging to it
- As a user, I want to be able to navigate to the item list inside a folder and manipulate the
items using the same UI implemented in Phase 1



**To execute the app just run executeApp.bat (node has to be installed to run the API)**
